Open the code1.PY file you have in this directory.
You will see two functions:  max and main.

In max, the algorithm is written as comments, but there is no code.
You should translate this algorithm to code.

In main, there are three print statements which call max and print
its result.  These would let you check if max is working right.

There is also a comment asking you to write one more print statement
with a call to max.  In that comment, it asks you to take the max
of two numbers (written as hex), and print them out.
Add a line of code to do this.
