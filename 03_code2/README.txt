Open the code2.py and code2.rs files you have in this directory.
You will see two functions:  printTriangle and main.

As with the previous problem, the printTriangle function
has an algorithm written as comments, but there is no code.
You should translate this algorithm to code.

In main, there are three print statements which print out a triangle
with height 4, and the total number of stars in that triangle (returned
by the printTriangle function).

There is also a comment asking you to write a few more statements
to do the same thing for a triangle of height 7.
Add the code to do this.
